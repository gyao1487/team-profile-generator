# Team Profile Generator

## Description
A simple application that runs on the command-line with Node.js to dynamically generate a professional README.md based on user's input using Inquirer. It allows for a quick and easy generation of a project README, as the user only needs to input the important information, leaving the busy work of formatting to the app.
